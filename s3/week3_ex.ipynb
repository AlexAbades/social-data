    "Is a measurement that indicates how strong two variables are correlated, specifically, the degree of linear association between two variables. It also indicates if they have positive or negative correlation (proportional or inversely proportional). It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation and -1 a perfect negative correlation. \n",
